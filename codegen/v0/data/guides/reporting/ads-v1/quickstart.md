# Quickstart guide

> [NOTE] The below content assumes you already have a working developer account. For more details on how to set that up, see the [Amazon Ads API onboarding overview](guides/onboarding/overview) as well as [how to make your first API call](guides/get-started/first-call).

## Creating your first report

In Version 3 Reporting, you worked within [report types](guides/reporting/v3/report-types/overview). Each report type had a set of supported metrics, dimensions, and ad programs. So, you could generate a `dspGeo` report to get aggregated metrics per postal code, or you could generate a `dspInventory` report to get aggregated metrics per supply source. However, you did not have a way to combine all of that into one report. With the new reporting API, that is now possible.

Your focus now is on fields. Fields can be either metric fields (e.g. `metric.impressions`) or dimension fields (e.g. `campaign.id`). When you create a report, you simply have to specify which fields you want to include in the report, and the aggregation will occur on all of your specified dimensions:

**POST /adsApi/v1/create/reports**

```bash
curl -X POST https://advertising-api.amazon.com/adsApi/v1/create/reports \
  -H "Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId: {YOUR_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "accessRequestedAccounts": [
    {
      "advertiserAccountId": "{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}"
    }
  ],
  "reports": [
    {
      "format": "CSV",
      "periods": [
        {
          "datePeriod": {
            "startDate": "2025-10-28",
            "endDate": "2025-11-04"
          }
        }
      ],
      "query": {
        "fields": [
          "date.value",
          "campaign.id",
          "campaign.name",
          "postalCode.value",
          "supplySource.name",
          "metric.impressions"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

In the above example, the included dimensions are `date`, `campaign`, `postalCode`, and `supplySource`. The generated report will aggregate the desired metrics (e.g. `metric.impressions`) for each combination of your selected dimensions in a `GROUP BY` fashion.

For example, the report above represents an eight day period of time (A=8). Say there were two active campaigns during that period (B=2). Each campaign was flighted in 10 postal codes (C=10), on 20 supply sources (D=20). The number of rows in the report would be `A * B * C * D = 3200`, and each row would include the metric totals for the dimension combination.

When you submit your request, we will provide you with a report ID, along with other metadata, in the response:

```json
{
  "error": null,
  "success": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "report": {
        "creationDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:00:38.285Z",
        "format": "CSV",
        "lastUpdatedDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:00:38.285Z",
        "periods": [
          {
            "datePeriod": {
              "startDate": "2025-10-28",
              "endDate": "2025-11-04"
            }
          }
        ],
        "query": {
          "fields": [
            "date.value",
            "campaign.id",
            "campaign.name",
            "postalCode.value",
            "supplySource.name",
            "metric.impressions"
          ]
        },
        "reportId": "{YOUR_REPORT_ID}",
        "status": "PENDING"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Retrieving your report

When you first create your report, the status will be `PENDING`, and the generation will occur asynchronously. It will transition through different statuses as the generation executes:

| Status     | Meaning                                                                                               | Terminal |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `PENDING`     | The report is pending, check back later.                                                              | -         |
| `PROCESSING`  | The report is processing, check back later.                                                           | -         |
| `COMPLETED`   | The report generation completed, see the `completedReportParts` for download information.               | Yes       |
| `FAILED`      | The report generation failed, see the `failureCode` and `failureReason` for more information.             | Yes       |

You can check the status of your report at any time by retrieving the report. The recommended frequency is once per minute:

**POST /adsApi/v1/retrieve/reports**

```bash
curl -X POST https://advertising-api.amazon.com/adsApi/v1/retrieve/reports \
  -H "Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId: {YOUR_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "reportIds": [
    "{YOUR_REPORT_ID}"
  ]
}'
```

The response will include the current `status`. Eventually, the report will transition to a terminal status — either `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. In the event of a report generation failure, the response includes information about the failure. See [Handling errors](guides/reporting/ads-v1/error-handling) for a full explanation of this flow.

When the report completes successfully, the response includes information about how to retrieve the report in the `completedReportParts`:

```json
{
  "error": null,
  "success": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "report": {
        "completedDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:12:50.443Z",
        "completedReportParts": [
          {
            "sizeInBytes": 1024000,
            "url": "{PRESIGNED_S3_URL}",
            "urlExpirationDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:12:50.443Z"
          }
        ],
        "creationDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:00:38.285Z",
        "format": "CSV",
        "lastUpdatedDateTime": "2025-11-05T00:00:38.285Z",
        "periods": [
          {
            "datePeriod": {
              "startDate": "2025-10-28",
              "endDate": "2025-11-04"
            }
          }
        ],
        "query": {
          "fields": [
            "dateRange.value",
            "metric.addToList",
            "budgetCurrency.value",
            "campaign.bidStrategy",
            "campaign.budgetAmount",
            "campaign.budgetType",
            "campaign.id",
            "campaign.name",
            "campaign.deliveryStatus",
            "metric.impressions"
          ]
        },
        "reportId": "{YOUR_REPORT_ID}",
        "status": "COMPLETED"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each report part will include a pre-signed S3 URL, and you can then download the report using your mechanism of choice. For example, with `curl`:

```bash
curl -L "{PRESIGNED_S3_URL}" -o desired_filename.csv
```

> [TIP] The new reporting API also supports new file formats, including partitioned reports across multiple files. See the [supported file formats](guides/reporting/ads-v1/new-features#expanded-file-formats) for more information.
